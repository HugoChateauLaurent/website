  abstract = {Conceptors, although biologically implausible, admirably capture high
dimensional dynamical patterns. This report contains a concise overview
of Conceptors and describes how the same dynamical pattern approximation
can be achieved, with limitations, in a biologically plausible manner
using the Neural Engineering Framework. Two methods are compared to
Conceptors with this goal in mind: Rhythmic Dynamic Movement Primitives,
both with and without point attractors. In terms of representing a
dynamic signal, Dynamic Movement Primitives implemented directly performed
well for low-frequency signals, while Conceptors performed well for
high-frequency sinusoidal signals. In terms of blending between dynamic
signals, Conceptors are distinct from Dynamic Movement Primitives, but
this usefulness of this is unclear.},
