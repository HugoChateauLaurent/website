    abstract = "Emotion theory needs to explain the relationship of language and
    emotions, and the embodiment of emotions, by specifying the computational
    mechanisms underlying emotion generation in the brain. We used Chris
    Eliasmith’s Semantic Pointer Architecture to develop POEM, a computational
    model that explains numerous important phenomena concerning emotions, including
    how some stimuli generate immediate emotional reactions, how some emotional
    reactions depend on cognitive evaluations, how bodily states influence the
    generation of emotions, how some emotions depend on interactions between
    physiological inputs and cognitive appraisals, and how some emotional reactions
    concern syntactically complex representations. We contrast our theory with
    current alternatives, and discuss some possible applications to individual and
    social emotions.",
