  title={A spiking neuron model of pharmacologically-biased fear conditioning in the amygdala},
  abstract={Network models that reconstruct (a) the dynamics of individual neurons, (b) the anatomy of specific brain regions, and (c) the behaviors governed by these regions are important for understanding mental disorders and their pharmacological treatment. We present a spiking neuron model of the rat amygdala that undergoes fear conditioning, and is appropriately modulated by GABA agonists like oxytocin (OXY). The network includes neural populations for the lateral (L), basal (B), central-lateral (CeL), and central-medial (CeM) amygdala; interneurons; inputs from cortex and hippocampus; and (Motor) output. The model is trained by pairing negative stimuli (footshocks) with neutral stimuli (auditory tones) within a prescribed context (conditioning cage). Prediction error signals drive associative learning of synaptic connection weights in L and B. Following an experimentally-vetted training regime, the model exhibits the fear response (freezing, via CeM inhibition of tonically driven Motor) to presentation of the conditioned tone or context. Furthermore, repeatedly presenting tones without shocks in a new context causes extinction of the fear response in that context, but not in others. To simulate the pharmacology of OXY, we excite L-, B-, and CeL-interneurons known to express the OXY receptor. Applying OXY during training and/or testing significantly impairs the modelâ€™s fear responses (Figure 1, mean and 95% confidence intervals reported over n=10 simulated trials), consistent with the reduced freezing observed in rats injected with OXY or other GABA agonists (muscimol). These results demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying fear conditioning, including associative learning, extinction, and pharmacology, can be understood through the dynamic interactions between amygdala nuclei. Extensions to the model will allow targeted biophysical manipulations and anatomical reconstructions of human amygdala; experimental predictions made from this model may profitably inform human pharmacology and the treatment of conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.},
