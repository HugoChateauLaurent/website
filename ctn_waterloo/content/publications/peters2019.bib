  abstract={Modelling biologically-plausible neural structures for intelligent agents presents a unique challenge when operating in real-time domains. Neurons in our brains have different response properties, firing rates, and propagation lengths, creating noise that cannot be reliably decoded. This research explores the strengths and limitations of LIF spiking neuron ensembles for application in OpenAI virtual environments. Topics discussed include how we represent arbitrary environmental signals from multiple senses, choosing between equally viable actions in a given scenario, and how one can create a generic model that can learn and operate in a verity of situations.},
