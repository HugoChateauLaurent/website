  abstract={Finger gnosis (the ability to identify which finger has been touched) and magnitude comparison (the ability to determine which of two numbers is larger) are surprisingly correlated. We present a spiking neuron model of a common component that could be used in both tasks: an array of pointers. We show that if the model's single tuned parameter is set to match human accuracy performance in one task, then it also matches on the other task (with the exception of one data point). This provides a novel explanation of the relation, and proposes a common component that could be used across cognitive tasks.},
