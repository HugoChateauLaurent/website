  abstract={
    Braindrop is the first neuromorphic system designed to be programmed at a high level of abstraction.
    Previous neuromorphic systems were programmed at the neurosynaptic level and required expert knowledge
    of the hardware to use. In stark contrast, Braindrop's computations are specified as coupled nonlinear
    dynamical systems and synthesized to the hardware by an automated procedure. This procedure not only
    leverages Braindrop's fabric of subthreshold analog circuits as dynamic computational primitives but also
    compensates for their mismatched and temperature-sensitive responses at the network level. Thus, a clean
    abstraction is presented to the user. Fabricated in a 28-nm FDSOI process, Braindrop integrates 4096 neurons
    in $0.65 \text{mm}^2$. Two innovations---sparse encoding through analog spatial convolution and weighted
    spike-rate summation though digital accumulative thinning---cut digital traffic drastically, reducing the
    energy Braindrop consumes per equivalent synaptic operation to 381 fJ for typical network configurations.
