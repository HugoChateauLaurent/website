  abstract={Silicon neurons designed using subthreshold analog circuit techniques offer low power and compact area but are
exponentially sensitive to threshold-voltage mismatch in transistors. The resulting heterogeneity in the neurons’ responses,
however, provides a diverse set of basis functions for smooth
nonlinear function approximation. For low-order polynomials,
neuron spiking thresholds ought to be distributed uniformly
across the function’s domain. This uniform distribution is difficult
to achieve solely by sizing transistors to titrate mismatch. With
too much mismatch, many neuron’s thresholds fall outside the
domain (i.e. they either always spike or remain silent). With too
little mismatch, all their thresholds bunch up in the middle of the
domain. Here, we present a silicon-neuron design methodology
that minimizes overall area by optimizing transistor sizes in
concert with a few locally-stored programmable bits to adjust
each neuron’s offset (and gain). We validated this methodology
in a 28-nm mixed analog-digital CMOS process. Compared to
relying on mismatch alone, augmentation with digital correction
effectively reduced silicon area by 38 percent.},
