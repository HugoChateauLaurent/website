  abstract = {
We propose a spiking recurrent neural network model of flexible
human timing behavior based on the delay network. The
well-known `scalar property' of timing behavior arises from
the model in a natural way, and critically depends on how many
dimensions are used to represent the history of stimuli. The
model also produces heterogeneous firing patterns that scale
with the timed interval, consistent with available neural data.
This suggests that the scalar property and neural scaling are
tightly linked. Further extensions of the model are discussed
that may capture additional behavior, such as continuative
timing, temporal cognition, and learning how to time.
