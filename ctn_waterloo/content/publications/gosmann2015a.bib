  abstract = {This report discusses how to implement the multiplication of two numbers in the NEF with a high accuracy. The main improvement will be achieved by using diagonal encoders instead of randomly distributed encoders. In the selection of the evaluation points a trade-off is found as they cannot give a uniform distribution when projected to the encoders while being limited to the input domain. That leads to an alternative multiplication network architecture improving the accuracy further.},
