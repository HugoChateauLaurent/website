  abstract={Predicting future vehicle behaviour is an essential task to enable safe
and situation-aware automated driving. In this paper, we propose to encapsulate
spatial information of multiple objects in a semantic vector-representation. Assuming that future vehicle motion is influenced not only by past positions but also by
the behaviour of other traffic participants, we use this representation as input for a
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequence to sequence prediction
of vehicle positions. We train and evaluate our system on real-world driving data
collected mainly on highways in southern Germany and compare it to other models
for reference},
