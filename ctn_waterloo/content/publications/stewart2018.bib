  abstract={We have previously shown that a biologically realistic spiking neuron implementation of an action selection/execution system (constrained by the neurological connectivity of the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus) is capable of performing complex tasks, such as the Tower of Hanoi, n-Back, and semantic memory search. However, because the neural implementation approximates a strict rule-based structure of a production system, such models have involved hand-tweaking of multiple parameters to get the desired behaviour. Here, we show that a simple, local, online learning rule can be used to learn these parameters, resulting in neural models of cognitive behaviours that are more reliable and easier to construct than with prior methods.},
