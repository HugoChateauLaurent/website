  abstract = {We explore the effects of parameters in our novel model of
model-based reinforcement learning. In this model, spiking
neurons are used to represent state-action pairs, learn state
transition probabilities, and compute the resulting Q-values
needed for action selection. All other aspects of model-based
reinforcement learning are computed normally, without neurons. We test our model on a two-stage decision task, and compare its behaviour to ideal model-based behaviour. While some
of these parameters have expected effects, such as increasing
the learning rate and the number of neurons, we find that the
model is surprisingly sensitive to variations in the distribution
of neural tuning curves and the length of the time interval between state transitions.},
