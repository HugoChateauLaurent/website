*** Course Coronavirus Response Summary ***

I have prepared a mitigation plan so that all students have reasonable and fair opportunity to earn course credit and cover the majority of course material. I have been providing email updates, and updated the website to reflect changes. Should you have concerns about specific changes, please contact me by 4pm, March 20. 

In summary, the plan includes syllabus updates and reducing the number of readings for the remaining topics. The commentaries we missed, will not be counted. Going forward commentaries are to be submitted on the day of the class and won't be accepted after 130p that day. The final test questions will be emailed to students (see below). The essay topics due date was move to Mar 23rd.  The remaining lectures will be online via Learn.

### Commentaries

At the _beginning_ of each lecture you are required to submit a ~100 word commentary on the claim, hypothesis, or issue that you found most interesting in the reading. Your commentary should identify the claim that interests you and the strongest evidence for and against it. The purpose of these commentaries is to ensure that everyone comes to class prepared for discussion. There is no penalty for missing 3. There will be approximately 20 over the term. Commentaries should be handed in on paper.

Covid update: For your daily commentaries, please send them to this email address (i.e., philpsych256@gmail.com), with the subject '[date] Daily Commentary' (e.g. '03/16/20 Daily Commentary' will be the subject for Monday).  Please email it to me on the day of the class.  Commentaries won't be accepted after 130p on the day of the class.
