title: PHIL/PSYCH 256 Midterm I

Six of the following questions will be on the midterm. You will have to answer 5 of those. You will have 80 min to complete the test in class.

1.	What does CRUM stand for? What is the analogy that this approach relies on (be specific). In what three ways is this analogy useful? Give an example of each. Give one instance of how the analogy clearly fails.

2.	What is the ‘definition theory’ (or ‘classical theory’) of concepts? What kinds of concepts (give examples) does the theory apply best to? Name and explain in some detail three major problems with this theory.

3.	What is the Chinese Room? How is it analogous to a production system? What is the Turing test? What are two things the Chinese Room thought experiment is intended to show? Describe one reply (other than the systems reply) and Searle's response to it.

4.	What’s the difference between a theory, model, program, and platform? Give an example of each.

5.	What is a schema (draw a diagram if appropriate, name all major features of a schema)? How does it relate to prototype theory? How can the structure of schemas be justified (give two examples)?

6.	Name three theories of concepts. Provide a definition for each. Name one problem for, and one strength of each theory.

7.	What are the main parts of a production system? What is a production? Give an example. How does 'forward' chaining work in a production system? How does 'backward' chaining work?

8.	Name three kinds of reasoning. Give an example of each. What are the main differences between each kind? How do they each relate to learning? Explain.

9.	What is the von Neumann architecture? What is the Turing machine? What are the central strengths of each? How do they combine to inform cognitive science?

10.	Name and describe five limitations of deductive reasoning for modelling cognitive systems.
