Congratulations to [Pete](/people/peter-duggins.html) and [Nat](/people/natarajan-vaidyanathan.html) on presenting their work at SfN this year!
Both gave excellent poster presentations!

Pete explored the effects of different drugs on his rodent model of fear conditioning. He developed a spiking neural model of the different nuclei of the amygdala with enough detail to allow biophysical manipulations.

Nat developed a spiking neural model of adaptation in motor control. This includes an extension of the [REACH](/publications/dewolf2014.html) model with a multimodal Kalman filter and replicates data in both human and non-human primates. "Spiking neuron model of motor control with adaptation to visuomotor rotation"
