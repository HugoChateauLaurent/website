intro: >
  Semantic pointers are neural representations that carry
  partial semantic content and are composable into the representational
  structures necessary to support complex cognition. These pages describe a
  cognitive architecture based on them. This architecture has been used to build
  the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun.

The book
[How to build a brain](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545/)
from Oxford University Press
was published in Spring 2013.
It exploits the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)
to develop the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA)
for cognitive modelling.
Semantic pointers are symbol-like structures that
are implemented in a subsymbolic architecture;
one can think of this as a
[synthesis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hot-thought/201306/the-new-synthesis-in-cognitive-science)
of prior approaches in cognitive science.

The book provides tutorials in [Nengo](http://nengo.ai)
to explain and demonstrate many
of the central concepts discussed in the book.  Click below for a summary and further
information on the SPA.
