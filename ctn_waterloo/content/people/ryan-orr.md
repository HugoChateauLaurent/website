I started my Masters in Computer Science at the lab in September 2016. I received my BASc in Computer Engineering (Entrepreneurship Option) from the University of Waterloo, and have completed internships at companies such as Facebook, A9.com, and SAP. I am currently focusing on learning about the brain to identify a specific area to research. Areas of interest currently include knowledge representation and emotion.
