## Bio

I am an Associate Research Officer at National Research Council Canada.
Previously I was a post-doctoral research associate working with Chris Eliasmith at
the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience at the Universit of Waterloo.
My initial training was as an engineer (B.A.Sc. in Systems Design
Engineering, University of Waterloo, 1999), my masters involved applying
experimental psychology on simulated robots (M.Phil. in Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence, University of Sussex, 2000), and my Ph.D. was on
cognitive modelling (Ph.D. in Cognitive Science, Carleton University, 2007).

I am also a co-founder of [Applied Brain Research](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/),
a research-based start-up company based around using low-power hardware (neuromorphic
computer chips) and adaptive neural algorithms.

## Research Interests

I believe that making progress in understanding any phenomenon as complex as
cognition requires the construction of computational models. The primary role
of these models is to test theories: as theories become more complex, we need
computational models to let us determine the quantitative predictions of these
theories. These models should also be _mechanistic_. That is, they should be
process models where the behaviour of the overall system is caused by the
interaction of internal components over time. These components should then
correspond to the components of the real system. To achieve this, my main
research interests are in the development of modelling tools to support large-
scale cognitive models. This has involved both high-level cognitive
architectures (such as ACT-R) and detailed neural models (such as the Neural
Engineering Framework). Of particular interest is models involving cognitive
reasoning, experience-based learning, and reinforcement learning to interact
with a complex environment. In concert with this, I have worked on statistical
tools for comparing modelling results with empirical results, and how such
results should be interpretted. In particular, instead of the standard
approaches of finding best-fit parameter settings based on minimizing the mean
squared error, I advocate finding a range of parameter settings for which the
model and reality are not statistically significantly different.
