Right now, my research interests are mostly focused on two different topics: extending the
Neural Engineering to work with more detailed neuron models, and using adaptive control and
filtering as a model of motor control and sensory inference in the brain.

Regarding my work on more detailed neuron models, I have been working on incorporating simple
multi-compartment models with conductance-based synapses into the NEF. My work shows that their
more complex nonlinearities can still be systematically exploited, and in fact reduce the neural
resources required to compute functions such as multiplication.

Regarding my work on adaptive control and filtering, I am working on constructing neurobiologically plausible
artificial agents. The hypothesis is that by constructing such agents in a more systematic manner ‒ at least
compared to a "Deep RL" agent ‒ the resulting system should be able to learn more efficiently, and in a
life-long fashion.

Apart from these focus areas, I am interested in a broad range of topics including ‒ but not limited to
‒ neuromorphic hardware, neurorobotics, and unsupervised learning strategies.

I'm teaching [SYDE 556/750 "Simulating Neurobiological Systems"](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/courses/syde-750.html) in Winter 2020.

Prior to joining the CNRG in January 2017, I have been a research assistant at the
[Cognitronics and Sensor Systems Group](http://www.ks.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/) in Bielefeld,
Germany, where I worked on neuromorphic hardware benchmarks and associative memory as part of the
[HBP neuromorphics subproject](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/silicon-brains/).

In my free time, I am either reading, building free software, tinkering with electronics,
writing terrible German fantasy novels, or wandering around aimlessly, getting lost.
